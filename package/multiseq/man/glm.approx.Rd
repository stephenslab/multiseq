\title{Fit the model specified in documentation, using either a weighted least squares approach or a generalized linear model approach, with some modifications.}
\usage{
glm.approx(x, g = NULL, minobs = 1, pseudocounts = 0.5, all = FALSE,
  eps = 1e-08, center = FALSE, repara = FALSE, forcebin = FALSE,
  lm.approx = FALSE, disp = c("add", "mult"), bound = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{x:}{a matrix of N (# of samples) by 2*B (B: # of WCs or, more precisely, of different scales and locations in multi-scale space); Two consecutive columns correspond to a particular scale and location; The first column (the second column) contains # of successes (# of failures) for each sample at the corresponding scale and location.}

\item{g:}{a vector of covariate values. Can be a factor (2 groups only) or quantitative. For a 2-group categorical covariate, provide \code{g} as a 0-1 factor instead of a 0-1 numeric vector for faster computation.}

\item{minobs:}{minimum number of non-zero required for each model to be fitted (otherwise NA is returned for that model).}

\item{pseudocounts:}{a number to be added to counts when counts are zero (or possibly extremely small).}

\item{all:}{bool, if TRUE pseudocounts are added to all entries, if FALSE (default) pseudocounts are added only to cases when either number of successes or number of failures (but not both) is 0.}

\item{center:}{bool, indicating whether to center \code{g}. If \code{g} is a 2-group categorical variable and centering is desired, use \code{center=TRUE} instead of treating \code{g} as numeric and centering manually to avoid slower computation.}

\item{repara:}{bool, indicating whether to reparameterize \code{alpha} and \code{beta} so that their likelihoods can be factorized.}

\item{forcebin:}{bool, if TRUE don't allow for overdipersion. Defaults to TRUE if \code{nsig=1}, and FALSE otherwise.}

\item{lm.approx:}{bool, indicating whether a WLS alternative should be used. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{disp:}{a string, can be either "add" or "mult", indicating the form of overdispersion assumed when \code{lm.approx=TRUE}.}

\item{bound:}{numeric, indicates the threshold of the success vs failure ratio below which pseudocounts will be added.}
}
\value{
a matrix of 2 (or 5 if g is provided, including the covariance parameter between intercept and slope) by B (# of WCs); each row contains alphahat (1st row), standard error of alphahat (2nd), and in addition (if g is provided), betahat (3rd), standard error of betahat (4th), covariance between alphahat and betahat (5th) for each WC.
}
\description{
This function fits many "simple" logistic regressions (ie zero or one covariate) simultaneously, allowing for the possibility of small sample sizes with low or zero counts. In addition, an alternative
model in the form of a weighted least squares regression can also be fit in place of a logistic regression.
